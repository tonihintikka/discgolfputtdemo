Let's build a Disc Golf Training Progressive Web App (PWA), focusing initially on a comprehensive putting practice module. The goal is to create an accessible and effective training tool based on the principles outlined in the provided research synthesis document.I want a modern PWA built using React with TypeScript. For UI components, we'll use Material Design (MUI), ensuring the application is visually appealing and user-friendly. The app must be installable and offer reliable offline functionality, particularly for the core putting drills and distance measurement features, allowing use on the course or practice field without internet connectivity.The initial putting module should include:Structured practice drills like "Circle 1X" (e.g., using metric equivalents like 3-10m) and "Circle 2" (e.g., 10-20m) with mechanics like the "5/5 Putts" game.Randomized distance/stance practice modes to simulate course variability.Tracking of make percentages by distance.Visual feedback related to the 'straight line putting principle' if feasible in the simulation.A key feature will be distance metering for putts:Implement pedometer-based distance measurement using the device's motion sensors (accelerometer via DeviceMotionEvent, requiring user permission) as the primary method. This will require user controls to start/stop the measurement walk (e.g., from basket to lie) and a way to calibrate or input average stride length (likely in meters).Integrate Geolocation API access to capture approximate GPS coordinates, primarily for context or "fun", acknowledging its limitations for precise short-distance measurement.Display the calculated pedometer distance clearly, showing both meters (m) and feet (ft) to accommodate user preference. The primary calculation will likely be in meters based on stride length, with feet displayed alongside via conversion.The initial user interface should allow easy selection of putting drills and initiation of the distance measurement feature. User progress data (putting stats, measured distances) should be stored locally for offline use (e.g., using IndexedDB) and potentially synced to a backend later if user accounts are added. The UI must be mobile-friendly and intuitive for use during practice sessions.
