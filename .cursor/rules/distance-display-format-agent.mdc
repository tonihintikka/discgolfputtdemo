# Distance Display Format

## Critical Rules

- Always display distances calculated via the pedometer (or other primary methods) with both metric (meters, `m`) and imperial (feet, `ft`) units.
- Clearly label which value is which (e.g., "10.2 m / 33.5 ft").
- Use a reasonable number of decimal places (e.g., one for meters, zero or one for feet).
- Ensure the conversion factor from meters to feet (approximately 3.28084) is applied correctly and consistently.
- The primary stored value should be in meters (as derived from stride length in meters).

## Examples

<example>
  Displaying a measured putt distance as: `Distance: 7.5 m / 24.6 ft`
  Storing the value `7.5` (meters) in IndexedDB.
  Using a utility function `formatDistance(meters: number): string` that returns the formatted string.
</example>

<example type="invalid">
  Displaying only meters: `Distance: 7.5 m`
  Displaying only feet: `Distance: 24.6 ft`
  Using inconsistent labeling or formatting: `7.5m (24ft 7in)`
  Rounding feet incorrectly or using too many decimal places: `7.5 m / 33.464567 ft`
