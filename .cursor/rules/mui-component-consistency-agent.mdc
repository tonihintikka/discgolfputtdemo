# MUI Component Consistency

## Critical Rules

- Prioritize using standard MUI components (`@mui/material`) for UI elements (Buttons, Cards, Lists, Inputs, etc.) unless a custom component is explicitly justified by unique project needs not covered by MUI.
- Apply MUI Theming consistently for colors, typography, and spacing to maintain a unified look and feel aligned with Material Design 3.
- Ensure interactive elements (buttons, inputs) follow MUI accessibility guidelines (e.g., proper labeling, keyboard navigation).
- When choosing components, consider their suitability for mobile-first design and responsiveness.

## Examples

<example>
  Using `<Button variant="contained">` for primary actions.
  Using `<TextField>` for user inputs.
  Using `<Card>` to display drill summaries or stats.
  Applying theme colors consistently via `sx` prop or `styled` components (e.g., `color: 'primary.main'`).
  Designing layouts with `<Grid>` or `<Stack>` for responsiveness.
</example>

<example type="invalid">
  Using custom-styled `<div>` elements instead of MUI `<Button>` for interactive buttons.
  Inconsistent typography (font sizes, weights) across different screens.
  Mixing MUI components with another UI library (like Bootstrap) within the same feature without clear separation or justification.
  Creating layouts that do not adapt well to smaller screen sizes.
